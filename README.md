# JavaScript-Projects
This is a collection of JavaScript Projects that I am currently building to practice and improve my JS skills. 
Starting relatively simple and working my way up to more advanced concepts and projects.
The main two tutorials that I will be using is :JavaScript Programming - Full Course (https://youtu.be/jS4aFq5-91M) and Build 15 JavaScript Projects - Vanilla JavaScript Course (https://youtu.be/3PHXvlpOkf4) with freeCodeCamp
